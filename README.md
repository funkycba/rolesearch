# rolesearch

## What is rolesearch for?
    There are jobs where management is everything and you need the right tools to work through these jobs more efficiently. When it comes to managing workers or other similar subjects, rolesearch fits the bill. With rolesearch, you are able to see a table of all the employees you are managing, their IDs, and roles.

## How does it function?
    The app is run by mysql to establish the table for all the mentioned variables. You also must remember to type "npm i" to recieve the package to get mysql running. Then there is an index js file that runs the prompt questions that are answered through filling in the blanks, usually for adding roles and employees. There is also the option to add a new department. Every variable added is automatically given a unique id for easier management. There is even the option to update an employee and change the role to a new one.

## Walkthrough Video
    In the github page where you will find the app, there is also a featured walkthrough video to demonstrate the functionality of the rolesearch. The options are selected one by one and the commands required are seen in the terminal.
